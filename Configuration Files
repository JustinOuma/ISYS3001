#### **2. Project Report**

**Example**:

In this project, we implemented Git for version control. We used a branching strategy that included a `main` branch for stable releases, feature branches for new developments, and hotfix branches for urgent bug fixes. This ensured a smooth and organized development workflow.

We also used configuration management to handle environment variables, allowing us to deploy the app across multiple environments with minimal changes. The `.env` and `config.json` files facilitated secure and flexible management of sensitive data and environment-specific settings.

#### **3. Procurement Request (RFP)**

Submit the RFPs you prepared, including the one for PostgreSQL, and explain why the selected tools fit the needs of the project.

This approach demonstrates your practical application of both configuration and procurement management principles, ensuring you meet the assignmentâ€™s requirements.
