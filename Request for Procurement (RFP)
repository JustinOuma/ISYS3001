Purpose
We require a relational database management system for our web application to store user data, transaction logs, and other application-related information.

Features
SQL support for structured data.
Scalability for future growth.
Strong data integrity and ACID compliance.

Budget Consideration
We are looking for a free tier or a budget-friendly cloud-hosted service for initial deployment.

Procurement Process
License: PostgreSQL is open-source and free to use.
Subscription: If opting for a managed service (e.g., AWS RDS), we will explore the free tier or low-cost subscription models.
